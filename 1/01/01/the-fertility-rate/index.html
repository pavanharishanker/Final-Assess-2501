<h1>A Gradually Declining Fertility Rate</h1>
<p>Exploring the Health Stats NSW data for the Total Fertility Rate [TFR] over the period of 2001 to 2019. We can see from the below plot, that whilst there was indeed a increase in the TFR during the 2005-2012 period. There has been significant decline in the Total Fertiltiy Rate in NSW from 2015 onwards. With a TFR of only <strong>1.59 in 2019</strong>, a substantial <strong>0.37 points below the all time high in 2007</strong>.</p>

<h1>Conclusive Remarks</h1>
<p>Thus, from examination of the above, we can see that a declining fertility and death rate, is contributing to a <strong>negative </strong> shift in the population age structure for the NSW State, with respects to productive capacity. The long-term impacts of which, are too early to measure as we begin this transition. However, if this trend towards an ageing population structure continues, there is <strong>undoubtable socioeconomic changes to arise as a corollary</strong>.</p>
